# PostgreSQL Course Documentation

Welcome to my comprehensive documentation of the PostgreSQL course led by Nikolai Schuler on Udemy.

This course is structured into 15 sections, each designed to be completed within a day. I aim to master PostgreSQL, tackling the given challenges at the end of each section to solidify my understanding.

## Repository Structure

Each section has found a home in its dedicated folder, housing a snapshot of the challenges posed and, more importantly, my SQL solutions presented in the README file.
